                    Diwali, or Deepawali, is observed with equal fervor by Hindus all over India, and the world. The festival was celebrated for the first time when Lord Rama returned to Ayodhya from exile after 14 long years. People of Ayodhya celebrated the event by lighting lamps on the doorsteps and windowsills. Even today, small clay lamps and candles are lit during the celebration. The lights represent the victory of the good over evil. The celebrations also mark numerous cultural programs. Exchanging sweets and gifts is also a long-standing tradition of Diwali.

                    <p>
                    There is also a tradition of worshipping Goddess Lakshmi on the evening of Diwali. Though Diwali is a 5-day festival, people start preparing for it weeks before the actual festival. They clean and beautify their houses. It’s said that Goddess Lakshmi only enters houses that are clean and brightly illuminated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The last day of Diwali marks the festival of Bhai Dooj. Bhai Dooj falls on the Shukla Paksha Dwitiya in the Hindu month of Kartik. It is known by various names in different regions of India. On this day, sisters perform aarti of their brothers and apply a ‘tilak’ on their forehead. This is followed by exchanging gifts and sweets.

                    Holi, also known as the “Festival of Colors,” is a festival of fun, mirth, frolic, dance, music and color. It commemorates the slaying of Holika, the she-demon, by Lord Vishnu’s ardent devotee Prahlad. It is also believed that Lord Shiva opened his third eye and burned Kamadeva to death on this day. People of South India worship Kamadeva for his extreme sacrifice on the day of Holi.

                    <p>
                    The name ‘Holi’ comes from the Sanskrit words from ‘Holika Dahanam’, which means ‘Holika’s slaying.’ This colorful festival is celebrated on the Purnima or Full moonaccording to the Hindu calendar. The ceremony of Holika Dahan is observed on the first day. The following day, people celebrate Holi by throwing colored powder and squirting colored water upon each other. Kids dunk each other in mud pools. In many parts of India, people also consume Bhang, a paste made from the cannabis plant, during Holi.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Holi is also celebrated in the memory of the immortal love of Radha and Krishna. Young Krishna would always complain to his mother why Radha had a fair complexion while he was dark. Yashodha suggested him to apply color on Radha’s face to change her complexion. In some regions, Holi glorifies the new harvest and return of color in nature. It is an important festival of India.

                Maha Shivratri, the great night of Shiva, is celebrated on the 14th day of the Margshirsh month. It commemorates the marriage of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. People celebrate this festival by fasting and offering Bilva leaves to Lord Shiva. There is also a tradition of giving a holy bath to the ‘Shiva Lingam’.

                <p>
                According to the legend, King Bhagirath left his kingdom to meditate for the salvation of the souls of his ancestor. He prayed incessantly to the holy River Ganga to wash over the ashes of his ancestor and release them from the curse so that they can go to the heaven. But only Lord Shiva could sustain the weight of his lineage. So he prayed to Lord Shiva, who, after meandering through the solid rocks, reached the earth. This story is reenacted by bathing the lingam.
